          <h3>Intro:</h3>
          <p>
            Subhas Chandra Bose, popularly known as Netaji, was a prominent
            figure in India's struggle for independence against British rule.
            Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, Netaji emerged as one
            of the most influential leaders in the Indian Nationalist Movement
            during the first half of the 20th century.

          <h3>Family Details:</h3>
          <p>
            Netaji was born into a prominent Bengali family. His father,
            Janakinath Bose, was a successful lawyer and his mother, Prabhavati
            Devi, hailed from a distinguished family known for their involvement
            in India's cultural and intellectual circles. Netaji's upbringing
            was marked by a deep sense of patriotism and a commitment to social
            justice, instilled in him by his parents from an early age.

          <h3>Education:</h3>
          <p>
            Netaji received his early education in Cuttack and excelled
            academically. He later moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata) to pursue
            higher studies. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in
            Philosophy from the prestigious Presidency College. Subsequently, he
            traveled to England to prepare for the Indian Civil Services (ICS)
            examinations. However, his experiences in England, coupled with his
            growing disillusionment with British colonialism, steered him
            towards nationalist politics.

          <h3>Works:</h3>
          <p>
            Netaji's political journey began with his involvement in the Indian
            National Congress, where he worked closely with Mahatma Gandhi.
            However, he eventually became disillusioned with the Congress'
            moderate approach towards independence and sought more radical
            methods to achieve India's freedom. In 1940, he famously escaped
            house arrest in India and made his way to Germany and then to Japan,
            seeking support for India's liberation from the Axis powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Japan, Netaji organized the Indian National Army (INA), composed
            primarily of Indian prisoners of war and expatriates. Under his
            leadership, the INA waged a military campaign against the British in
            Southeast Asia during World War II. Netaji's stirring speeches and
            charismatic leadership inspired thousands of Indians to join the
            struggle for independence.

          <h3>Outro:</h3>
          <p>
            Though the INA's military campaigns were not entirely successful,
            Netaji's contributions to the Indian freedom movement were immense.
            His slogan "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom" galvanized
            the Indian masses and left an indelible mark on the nation's
            consciousness. Tragically, Netaji's life was cut short in a
            mysterious plane crash in 1945, under circumstances that remain
            controversial and subject to speculation even today. Despite his
            premature demise, Netaji's legacy as a fearless freedom fighter and
            visionary leader continues to inspire generations of Indians.
